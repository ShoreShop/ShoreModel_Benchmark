## Background and Objectives <a name="Background"></a>
### Background
Shoreline change prediction has witnessed the evolution of both hybrid and data-driven models, offering valuable insights into how coastlines respond to varying wave conditions across different timescales. Building on the success of the ShoreShop 1.0 ([Blind testing of shoreline evolution models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59018-y)) in 2018, which tested 19 shoreline models in predicting shoreline positions over a four-year period, ShoreShop 2.0 aims to further explore and showcase the evolution of predictive methods.
### Objectives
- **Diverse Methodology Showcase**: With the rapid advancements in data-driven models and the increasing availability of shoreline measurements, ShoreShop 2.0 intends to highlight the diversity of methods available for predicting shoreline changes.
- **Blind Testing Element**: Drawing inspiration from ShoreShop 1.0, ShoreShop 2.0 retains its core feature of blind testing to provide unbiased evaluations of the predictive models.
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  1. Assessing the performance of shoreline models using freely available datasets such as satellite-derived shorelines and modelled wave conditions.
  2. Evaluating the capabilities of shoreline models for short-term (5 years) and medium-term (50 years) predictions while discussing their potential for long-term predictions (80 years).
  3. Investigating the variability in shoreline model accuracy along the coastline of an embayed beach.

Join us at ShoreShop 2.0 to learn about the latest advancements, share insights, and foster collaborative efforts in shoreline change prediction.

### Notebooks

The following notebooks are available in this repo:
- [1.data_explore.ipynb](https://github.com/yongjingmao/ShoreModel_Benchmark/blob/main/1.data_explore.ipynb): explore the input transect, shoreline and wave data.
- [2.model_compare.ipynb](https://github.com/yongjingmao/ShoreModel_Benchmark/blob/main/2.model_compare.ipynb): compare and evaluate all the submitted model predictions against the target shoreline positions.

## Task description
### Beach_X
A real-world Beach_X serves as the target site for this workshop. To ensure a blind test, all geographical information regarding this beach has been intentionally removed. \
What we do know is that Beach_X is an east-facing embayed sandy beach with a mean grain size ***D50 â‰ˆ 0.3 mm***. The depth of closure for this beach is 11 m and the corresponding slope of the active beach profile is about 0.022.\
9 shore-normal transects are established from North to South with a 100-meter longshore distance to measure shoreline position. The coordinates for the landward and seaward ends of transects are provided in `transects_coords.csv`.
These coordinates are in a local coordinate system, deliberately shifted (not distorted or rotated), and are expressed in easting (x) and northing (y) with a unit of meters. They do not reveal the actual geographical location of Beach_X.

### Tasks
Given 20 years shoreline position data in the 1999-2018 period, along with the shoreline position in 1951-05-01 as well as wave and sea level data spanning from 1940 to 2100, participants are tasked with:

- ***Task1.Short-term prediction***: Predict the shoreline position between **2019-01-01 and 2023-12-31** with **daily** timestep.
- ***Task2.Medium-term prediction***: Predict the shoreline position between **1951-05-01 and 1998-12-31** with **daily** timestep.
- ***Task3.Long-term prediction***: Predict the shoreline position between **2019-01-01 and 2100-12-31** with **daily** timestep (no evaluation).

### Evaluation
- **Target transects**: The target transects used for evaluation include ***Transects 2, 5 and 8*** in the North end, the middle and the South end of the beach respectively.
- **Target shorelines**: For each target transect, the model prediction will be evaluated against the observed shoreline data at target datetimes. The target datetimes for short-term and medium-term tasks are in `shorelines_target_short.csv` and `shorelines_target_medium.csv`. For blind testing, the observed shoreline data in the target window will be withheld for all participants. The long-term prediction will **not** be evaluated, and the results are only for discussion.
- **Evaluation metrics**: [Taylor diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_diagram) (consisting of centered root-mean-square error (CRMSE, bias excluded), Correlation and standard deviation (STD)) will be used to visualize and compare the model performance for each of the target transect.\
For quantitative comparison, root-mean-square error (RMSE, bias included), Correlation and STD are integrated into a single metrics. RMSE and STD of prediction are normalized by dividing them by the STD of the observation (target). This ensures that all three statistical parameters in the diagram are normalized. The loss function $\mathcal{L_i}$ is then defined by intergrating the three parameters for each target transect. The average loss across all target transects $\mathcal{L_avg}$ serves as the final metric for ranking the model performance. Please note that due to the difference between CRMSE and RMSE, the $\mathcal{L_i}$ is indicative of, but not identical to, the distance between the model points and the target point (the black triangle) in the Taylor diagram.
  
$$ RMSE_{norm} = \frac{RMSE_{pred}}{STD_{targ}},   STD_{norm} = \frac{STD_{pred}}{STD_{targ}}$$

$$ \mathcal{L_i} = \sqrt{(0-RMSE_{norm})^2+(1-Corr)^2+(1-STD_{norm})^2} $$
  
$$ \mathcal{L_avg} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathcal{L_i} $$

### Shoreline
The shoreline data (`shorelines_obs.csv`) utilized in the ShoreShop 2.0 workshop is derived from public satellite images captured by Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 satellites. This data has been processed using [CoastSat](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat), a public toolbox specifically designed for coastline analysis. \
The satellite-derived shoreline (SDS) data for model calibration/training starts from 1999 and ends at 2018 with 347 time steps. \
The shoreline position (m) is defined as the distance from the landward end of a transect to the intersection of the shoreline and the transect. \
All the shorelines have been corrected to reflect the instantaneous position at Mean Sea Level.\
The reported accuracy of CoastSat-derived shorelines is 8.9 m against ground-truth data at Narrabeen Beach. For Beach_X, based on validation against a limited number of photogrammetry data points, the RMSE of the SDS shoreline (as shown in the figure below) is less than 7 m for transects 1â€“8, and around 15 m for transect 9, which is located near the headland.

For short-term shoreline prediction, The `shorelines_target_short.csv` contains the target dates from 2019 to 2023. All shoreline position values are intentionally withheld for all participants. During the evaluation phase, participants' predictions will be compared against the withheld shoreline position data from the SDS dataset.

For medium-term shoreline prediction, `shorelines_target_medium.csv` provides shoreline data for the date 1st May 1951, serving as the context data for the medium-term prediction task. Additional target dates are included for medium-term prediction. Participants' predictions will be evaluated against photogrammetry (pre-1989) and SDS (1989-1998) data available for the respective target dates.

### Hindcast wave data
The hindcast wave data used in this workshop was obtained by downscaling offshore directional wave spectra to nearshore areas.
The offshore wave data is from the [ERA5 Wave Hindcast](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview). 
The [BinWaves](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500324000337) approach was applied to transform the offshore wave data to nearshore.
The significant wave height (Hs), peak wave period (Tp) and mean wave direction (Dir) were extracted along each shore-normal transect at 10 (m) depth contour with a daily interval from 1940 to 2023. Wave roses for the three target transects are shown below to demonstrate the minimal longshore variation of wave conditions.

<img src="figures/wave_roses.jpg" width="800">

### Forecast wave data
The forecast wave data were made using a nested WAVEWATCH III wave model with surface wind data from the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator ([ACCESS](https://researchdata.edu.au/access1-0-climate-r2i1p1-ensemble/259215)) as inputs. Wave projections have been performed for medium range carbon (RCP4.5) and high range (RCP8.5) carbon emission scenarios throughout 2006-2100.
The offshore wave forecast was transformed to nearshore following the same approach applied to hindcast wave data.
For each transect, to ensure the consistency between the hindcast and forecast data, the forecast wave climates were calibrated to have the same seasonality and joint distribution of Hs, Tp and Dir over the period of 2006~2023 with the multivariate bias correction algorithm ([MBCn](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3580-6)). Calibration results with hindcast data as reference for Transect1 under RCP4.5 scenario are shown below.

<img src="figures/cali_eval_Transect1_Hs_RCP45.jpg" width="600">

### Tide data
`tide.csv` contains the daily average of tidal height from [FES2014]([https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/es/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes/description-fes2014.html](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/index.php?id=1279&L=1)) model. Tidal components M2, S2, K1 and O1 were used for reconstruction. Tidal height is **the same for all transects**.

### Sea level data
`sealevel_obs.csv` contains the annual sea level data from gauge measurement (1950-2018). `sealevel_proj.csv` contains the sea level projection under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (2019-2100). 
The projection data is from NASA's [SEA LEVEL PROJECTION TOOL](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool), which is based on the regional sea level projections provided in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (AR6). Sea level is **the same for all transects**.

<img src="figures/SLR_ts.jpg" width="500">

### Bathymetry and slope data
`slope.csv` contains the beach-face slope for each transect derived from SDS with the [CoastSat.slope](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat.slope) tool.
