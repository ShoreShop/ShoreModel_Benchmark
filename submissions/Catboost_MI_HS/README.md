## Catboost model
### Model description

CatBoost is an advanced boosting algorithm specifically designed to handle categorical features effectively. CatBoost uses balanced symmetric trees for enhanced training and inference efficiency. The structure prevents overfitting and enhances generalization. CatBoost also uses advanced gradient descent techniques and optimization strategies to improve both its robustness and computational efficiency. CatBoost excels in attaining high accuracy and efficiency when dealing with large datasets characterized by numerous categorical features. It excels in predictive performance and ease of use when compared to other boosting algorithms. Due to its versatility in handling various data types and the reduced need for extensive preprocessing, it is widely used in practical applications.



### Model classification
#### Model mechanics
- [ ] Process-Based Models (PBM): couple hydrodynamics, waves, and morphodynamics through mass and momentum conservation laws.
- [ ] Hybrid Models (HM): use observational data to calibrate free parameters in the equilibrium configuration of a system.
- [x] Data-Driven Models (DDM): use observational data to train regression models (e.g. machine learning, statistical downscaling).
#### Model elements (multiple choices)
- [ ] Cross-shore: model the shoreline position for each transect independently.
- [x] Long-shore: incorporate the interaction of shoreline position across different transects.
- [ ] Sea level: consider the impact of sea level rise on shoreline position.
